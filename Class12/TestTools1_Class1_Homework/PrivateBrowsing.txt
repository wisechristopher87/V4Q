I noticed when i went into the developer tools while incognito mode that alot of the browser was "depreciated".
I was also getting an error that "A Mutation Operation was attempted on a database that did not allow mutations."
I also noticed that Home depot did not pop up on my history tab. 

I think one would like to use this mode if they wished to not be "ad targeted" through cookies. 
You could use this to test a website and see if it is still able to operate properly while viewing it in incognito/dark mode.
